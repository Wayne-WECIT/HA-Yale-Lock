# Changelog: Always Update

When you make any code or feature changes in this project:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a new section at the **top** of the changelog (below the "Changelog" heading), using the format already in the file:
   - `## [X.Y.Z.W] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - A short heading and bullet list of what changed (frontend, backend, fixes, etc.).

2. **Bump version when releasing**: If the change is user-facing (features, fixes, UI), update the version in **both**:
   - `custom_components/yale_lock_manager/const.py` — set `VERSION` to the new value (e.g. `1.8.4.44`).
   - `custom_components/yale_lock_manager/manifest.json` — set `"version"` to the same value.

3. **Include CHANGELOG and version files in the same commit** as the code change (or in the follow-up commit that documents the release).

Do not merge or ship code changes without a corresponding CHANGELOG entry.
