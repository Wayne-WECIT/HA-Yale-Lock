# Git: Commit and Push After Changes

After completing any code changes in this project:

1. **Stage** all modified/added files that are part of the change (e.g. `git add <paths>` or `git add -A` if the whole change set is intended).
2. **Commit** with a clear, descriptive message (e.g. what was fixed or added).
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push origin main`.

Do not leave pushing to the user. The user tests by pulling from the repo, so every change must be pushed. If `git push` fails with a proxy error (e.g. "Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 9"), retry with proxy env vars cleared for the command (e.g. in PowerShell: `$env:HTTP_PROXY=""; $env:HTTPS_PROXY=""; git push origin main`). If it still fails, report the error and suggest they run `git push origin main` locally; still complete commit so changes are saved.
