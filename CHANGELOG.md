## [1.0.1.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed blocking I/O warning: Card file copy now runs in executor (non-blocking)
- Home Assistant no longer complains about `shutil.copy2()` blocking the event loop
- Proper async/await handling for file operations

## [1.0.1.1] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- Card is now automatically copied to `www/yale_lock_manager/` during integration setup
- Card URL changed from `/local/community/yale_lock_manager/` to `/local/yale_lock_manager/`
- No manual card file copying needed - fully automatic!
- Works correctly with HACS custom repositories

### Technical
- Added `_async_setup_frontend()` function to handle card installation
- Integration automatically creates `www/yale_lock_manager/` directory if needed

## [1.0.1.0] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed multiple `'HomeAssistant' object has no attribute 'helpers'` errors in coordinator
- Fixed `'HomeAssistant' object has no attribute 'callback'` error in sensor
- Properly imported device_registry and entity_registry modules throughout
- Fixed @callback decorator usage in event listeners

### Changed
- Moved Lovelace card from `www/yale-lock-manager-card/` to `custom_components/yale_lock_manager/www/`
- Card is now served from `/local/community/yale_lock_manager/yale-lock-manager-card.js`
- Card file is automatically installed with the integration via HACS

## [1.0.0.3] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed import error: `AttributeError: 'HomeAssistant' object has no attribute 'helpers'`
- Properly imported entity_registry module (was causing 500 Internal Server Error)
- Config flow now loads correctly

## [1.0.0.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Improved lock detection to check for actual lock entities (most reliable method)
- Added multiple detection methods for Yale locks (manufacturer, model, name)
- Now detects ANY Z-Wave lock with a lock entity, not just Yale
- Added debug logging for lock detection

### Changed
- Lock detection now checks entity registry for lock entities first
- More robust Yale model detection (checks for KFCON model patterns)

## [1.0.0.1] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Lock detection in config flow - now properly detects Yale locks regardless of model name
